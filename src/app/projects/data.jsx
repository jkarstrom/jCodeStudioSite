      The Glenda Gordy Research Center (GGRC) site was built with a user-first mindset, focused on delivering crucial crime data in a way that is both accessible and actionable.

      Throughout the project, I worked closely with backend developers to ensure that the user interface was not only visually intuitive but also functionally powerful. Together, we designed a system where users could filter, explore, and interact with live datasets, adjusting parameters to surface the information most relevant to their needs.

      Every decision was driven by usability: ensuring that citizens, researchers, and decision-makers could easily navigate complex data without feeling overwhelmed. Leveraging React, Next.js, and Tailwind, I created a responsive, accessible experience that delivers critical transparency while maintaining speed and simplicity.

      The GGRC site represents a blend of thoughtful design, technical collaboration, and a commitment to empowering users through information.

      Building this site was more than just another project — it was a personal commitment to fully express who I am as a developer, designer, and creative thinker. 
      I wanted to craft something that felt distinctly mine: polished, imaginative, and intentionally different.
      
      From branding and design to development and project management, every decision was led by the standards I set for myself. 
      As my own client and project manager, I held myself accountable to create something that reflects not just what I can build, but how I think, solve problems, and bring ideas to life.
      
      This site showcases the many sides of my work — blending technical skill with creativity, and giving you a window into the journey, the process, and the passion behind everything I do.

      The Drive Performance site was designed and developed to showcase an elite training facility in Lake Bluff, IL. 
      Built with a clean, performance-driven interface, it highlights the facility's baseball and strength training programs, coaching staff, and facility details.
      
      I focused on creating a fast, mobile-optimized experience with a bold design that mirrors the Drive brand. 
      The project included dynamic service pages, a photo gallery, and integrated booking links, all managed seamlessly through Vercel hosting.
      
      Drive Performance demonstrates how thoughtful web design can enhance a brand’s online presence and make it easy for athletes and parents to explore training options and connect directly with coaches.
